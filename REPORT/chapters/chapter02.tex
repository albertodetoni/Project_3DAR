\section{Data}
\subsection{Dataset}
The data of the experiment are divided into two groups of images, one used for the training of the autoencoder and another one for the testing. The images represent four buildings from different point of view and in the training group we have the Portello and the Castle images, reported in fig.ref{fig:portello} and fig.ref{fig:castle}. Instead in the group of the testing images we have the FountainP-11 and the Tiso, reported in fig.ref{fig:fountain} and fig.ref{fig:tiso}. The images must be converted into grayscale to be used in the detectSURFFeatures function.
